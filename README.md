 (to be filled out by Recorded Future)



Brand Protection	High volume of data sources makes it difficult to monitor brand misuse effectively and validate the credibility of threats.	
	Difficulty in detecting relevant content due to the use of multiple languages and slang in threat actor communications or posts.	
		


Advanced Threat Hunting & Research	Manual threat research is time consuming lack of real-time intelligence on emerging threats and IOCs.	
	Numerous threat intelligence sources with inconsistent quality, difficult to centralize, validate, and act on critical insights in a timely manner.	
	High volume of irrelevant alerts and false positives makes it hard to prioritize real threats.
